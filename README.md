# What I learned
* How to code a fully responsive navbar using JavaScript! It's been a bane of me for a while.
* How to add an animation to a card: slide up more information on hover.
* Basics of SEO, so that the page comes up in search and is decently ranked. (later on my client wanted to NOT include any SEO by name and surname, so I removed it)
* How to use intersection observer for improved lazy laoding of images

# TODO
* ~~work on SEO~~
* ~~add animation to images~~
* ~~add PHP to the form to make it send emails~~
* ~~set aspect ratio to images in the gallery~~
* ~~finish up the design~~
* ~~style contact section~~
* ~~add about me section~~
* ~~fix navigation~~
* add a modal to image upon click
